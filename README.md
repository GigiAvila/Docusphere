# DOCUSPHERE - Landing Page Description
The Landing Page is fully styled using the Styled Components library and Chakra UI.

I have also practiced using LocalStorage in the SignIn section. You are free to try it out with my testing user. Otherwise, you will receive an alert:

    userName: 'TestUserName',
    loginEmail: 'test@example.com',
    loginPassword: 'TestPassword',
